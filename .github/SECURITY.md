| Version | Supported          |

_As the project is in its early stages, we recommend always using the latest version available._

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it to us privately to protect the project and its users.

Please email a detailed report to **mthunsche+public-detective@gmail.com**.

Your report should include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- The affected version(s).
- Any potential impact you have identified.

## Our Commitment

When you report a vulnerability, we commit to the following:

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.
- We will provide you with a timeline for addressing the vulnerability and keep you updated on our progress.
- We will notify the community once the vulnerability has been patched. We will credit you for your discovery unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Scope

Our security policy covers vulnerabilities found in the following areas:

- The main application code located in the `source/` directory.
- The project's infrastructure configuration if it poses a direct security risk.

## Out of Scope

The following issues are considered out of scope for our vulnerability disclosure program:

- Attacks requiring physical access to a user's device or the server.
- Social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing).
- Issues related to third-party services or dependencies (please report those to the respective service or library maintainers).
- Denial-of-service attacks that are not resource exhaustion issues.
- Reports of missing security headers that do not lead to a direct vulnerability.

## Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted under this policy to be authorized and will not pursue legal action against you. We ask that you make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, degradation of our services, or destruction of data.

Thank you for helping keep Public Detective and our users safe.
