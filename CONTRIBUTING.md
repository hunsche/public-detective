## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, and many of them don't involve writing a single line of code.

### üêõ Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug‚Äîsomething isn't working as expected‚Äîplease [open a bug report issue](https://github.com/hunsche/public-detective/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). Be sure to include as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the bug, the expected outcome, and the actual outcome.

### üí° Suggesting Enhancements
Have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one? We'd love to hear it. [Open a feature request issue](https://github.com/hunsche/public-detective/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) to start the discussion. This is a great way to contribute your ideas and domain expertise.

### üìñ Improving Documentation
Good documentation is key to a successful open-source project. If you find typos, unclear sentences, or areas in the `README.md` or other documents that could be improved, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request with your suggested changes.

### üíª Writing Code
If you're ready to jump into the code, we're excited to have you. You can help by:
- Picking up an existing issue labeled `help wanted` or `good first issue`.
- Implementing a new feature you've discussed with the team.
- Adding or improving tests.

## Your First Code Contribution

Ready to submit code? Here‚Äôs our workflow. It‚Äôs as easy as 1-2-3-4-5-6-7!

### 1. Fork the Repository
Fork the project to your own GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the main repository page.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExOXE2ZDBpb2I1aW45MWFjZDNkeHdqbXI2eGFhandvNjNtNXZoNWZ5cCZlcD12MV9naWZzX3NlYXJjaCZjdD1n/103R2H9RN2QZgc/200.gif" alt="Fork" width="400"/>
</div>

### 2. Create a Branch
Create a new branch from `main` in your fork for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name.
```sh
git checkout -b feature/my-new-amazing-feature
```

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdDhhMzk3Y2Z5cmFkdWJpejg4NW9vZzQ5MXUzdDdkaDljMW40Z2hrZyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/e5zHi5hgalk1sLVI1m/giphy.gif" alt="Branching out" width="400"/>
</div>

### 3. Set Up Your Dev Lair (Environment)
Make sure your development environment is set up by following the instructions in the `README.md`.

```sh
# Install dependencies
poetry install
```

### 4. Make Your Changes
Implement your feature or fix the bug. Make sure your code is clean, and follows the project's style.

<div align="center">

</div>

### 5. Commit Your Changes
Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

```sh
# Example of a commit message
git commit -m "feat: Add new detector for overly restrictive deadlines"
```

Common prefixes include:

  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation only changes
  - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
  - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### 6. Push to Your Branch
Push your new branch to your forked repository.

```sh
git push origin feature/my-new-amazing-feature
```

### 7. Open a Pull Request
Go to the `hunsche/public-detective` repository on GitHub and open a new Pull Request.

- Make sure your PR is against the `main` branch of the original repository.
- Provide a clear title and a detailed description of your changes. Explain *what* you changed and *why*.
- If your PR addresses an open issue, link to it in the description (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

Once your PR is open, a project maintainer will review it. We may ask for changes, but we'll work with you to get your contribution merged. We appreciate your effort!

## The Detective's Toolkit (Style Guides)

### Python Code
This project uses [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically manage code formatting and quality checks. The configuration is defined in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file at the root of the project.

After you run `pre-commit install` once, these hooks will be active. Now, every time you run `git commit`, `pre-commit` will automatically run tools like:

  - **[Black](https://github.com/psf/black):** for consistent code formatting.
  - **[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/):** for identifying programming errors and style violations.
  - **[isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/):** for automatically sorting imports.

If any of these checks fail, your commit will be aborted. Simply review the error messages (some tools like Black will fix the files for you automatically), `git add` the changes, and try to commit again. This process ensures that all code committed to the repository maintains a high standard of quality and a consistent style.

### Git Commit Messages
As mentioned above, we use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard. This helps us automate changelogs and makes the project history more readable.

## ü§ì Workflow Overview
The application operates in a multi-stage pipeline: a lightweight **Pre-analysis** stage to discover and prepare data, an on-demand trigger for the **Analysis** stage, and an asynchronous **Worker** to handle the AI processing. This decoupled architecture ensures efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

The diagram below illustrates the complete workflow:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Stage 1: Pre-analysis (Scheduled CLI)"
        A[Start: `pd analysis prepare`] --> B{Fetch procurements from PNCP API};
        B --> C[For each procurement...];
        C --> D{Calculate content hash<br>to ensure idempotency};
        D --> E[Estimate analysis cost<br>input tokens only];
        E --> F[Save initial record to Database<br>Status: PENDING_ANALYSIS<br>Cost: *Estimated*];
    end

    subgraph "Stage 2: Analysis (On-demand Trigger)"
        G[Start: `pd analysis run`] --> H{User or scheduler triggers analysis<br>for a specific ID};
        H --> I[Publish message to Pub/Sub topic];
    end

    subgraph "Stage 3: Worker (Asynchronous Processing)"
        J[Background worker consumes message] --> K[Retrieve analysis details & documents];
        K --> L[Prepare files & build prompt];
        L --> M[Submit to Google Gemini API];
        M --> N[Receive AI analysis & token usage];
        N --> O[Calculate *actual* total cost<br>input + output + thinking];
        O --> P{Save final results to Database<br>Status: ANALYSIS_SUCCESSFUL<br>Cost: *Actual*};
        P --> Q[Save actual expense to Budget Ledger];
    end

    F --> G;
    I -.-> J;

    M -- On Failure --> R[Update status in DB<br>Status: ANALYSIS_FAILED];
```
