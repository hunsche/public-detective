## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What's This All About?

Ever feel like public spending is a black box? In Brazil, billions are spent on public contracts, but keeping an eye on all of it is a Herculean task. Mistakes, inefficiencies, and even fraud can hide in mountains of documents.

**Public Detective** is here to change the game. We're an AI-powered watchdog that sniffs out irregularities in public tenders. Think of it as a digital detective, working 24/7 to help journalists, activists, and you demand transparency.

This isn't just code; it's a mission. Developed at **PUCPR** with the help of the amazing folks at **Transpar√™ncia Brasil**, this project puts cutting-edge tech in the hands of the people.

## üåü Core Features

- **ü§ñ Automated Data Retrieval:** Fetches procurement data directly from the official PNCP APIs.
- **üí° AI-Powered Analysis:** Uses a Generative AI model to flag potential red flags and provide a detailed risk score with a rationale.
- **üóÉÔ∏è Full Traceability:** Archives both original and processed documents in Google Cloud Storage for every analysis.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Idempotent by Design:** Avoids re-analyzing unchanged documents by checking a content hash.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Magic Happens

The application operates in a two-stage pipeline: a lightweight **Pre-analysis** stage to discover and prepare data, followed by an on-demand, AI-powered **Analysis** stage. This decoupled architecture ensures efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

Here‚Äôs a simplified look at how it works:

    end

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

- **Language:** Python 3.12+
- **AI / NLP:** Google Gemini API
- **CLI Framework:** Click
- **Database & Migrations:** PostgreSQL, managed with Alembic
- **Core Toolkit:**
  - **SQLAlchemy Core:** For writing safe, raw SQL queries.
  - **Textract:** For extracting content from various document formats.
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Pub/Sub

## üèÅ Get Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.12
-   Poetry
-   Docker
-   **`antiword`**: Required by the `textract` library to extract text from legacy `.doc` files.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/hunsche/public-detective.git
    cd public-detective
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file from the example. This is primarily used to configure local emulators.
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Authentication with Google Cloud is handled automatically. See the
    [Authentication](#-authentication) section for more details.

4.  **Start services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
5.  **Apply database migrations:**
    ```bash
    poetry run alembic upgrade head
    ```

## üîê Authentication

This project uses the **Vertex AI** backend for the Google Gemini API and authenticates using a standard Google Cloud pattern called [Application Default Credentials (ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials). This provides a secure and flexible mechanism that works across different environments.

The application attempts to find credentials in the following order:

1.  **`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` Environment Variable:**
    -   **Use Case:** This is the standard Google Cloud method to force the application to use a specific service account. It's useful for local development or CI/CD.
    -   **To Use:** Set the environment variable to the **absolute path** of your service account's JSON key file.
    -   **‚≠ê E2E Test Convention:** To make running E2E tests easier, this project uses the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS` variable (defined in `.env.example`). You should paste the **full JSON content** of your key there. The test suite will automatically handle creating a temporary file and setting the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` path for you during the test run.

2.  **`gcloud` CLI Credentials (for Local Development):**
    -   **Use Case:** The most common method for local development.
    -   **To Use:** If the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS` variable is not set, the application will use the credentials of the user logged into the `gcloud` CLI. To set this up, run:
        ```sh
        gcloud auth application-default login
        ```

3.  **Attached Service Account (Recommended for Production on GCP):**
    -   **Use Case:** When running the application on Google Cloud infrastructure (e.g., Cloud Run, GKE, Compute Engine).
    -   **How it Works:** The application automatically detects and uses the service account attached to the host resource. This is the most secure method for production as it eliminates the need to manage and store credential files.
    -   **To Use:** Ensure the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is **unset**, and the host's service account has the necessary IAM permissions (e.g., "Vertex AI User"). Also, ensure any emulator-specific environment variables (like `GCP_GEMINI_HOST`) are cleared so the application connects to the live Google Cloud APIs.

## üíª How to Use

The application is controlled via a unified Command-Line Interface (CLI) accessible through the `pd` alias. This provides a structured and intuitive way to manage the application's lifecycle, from database migrations to data analysis.

### Core Commands

The CLI is organized into logical groups:

-   **`analysis`**: Commands for running the different stages of the procurement analysis pipeline.
-   **`config`**: Tools for managing the application's configuration.
-   **`db`**: Utilities for database management, including migrations.
-   **`worker`**: Commands to control the background worker responsible for processing analysis tasks.

To see all available commands, you can run:

```bash
pd --help
```

### `analysis` Group

This group contains the core logic for the analysis pipeline.

-   **`pd analysis prepare`**: Scans for new procurements within a given date range and prepares them for analysis.

    ```bash
    # Prepare procurements from a specific date range
    pd analysis prepare --start-date 2025-01-01 --end-date 2025-01-05
    ```

-   **`pd analysis run`**: Triggers a specific analysis by its ID.

    ```bash
    # Run analysis for a specific ID
    pd analysis run --analysis-id "a1b2c3d4-..."
    ```

-   **`pd analysis rank`**: Ranks pending analyses based on a budget and triggers them.

    ```bash
    # Trigger ranked analysis with a manual budget
    pd analysis rank --budget 100.00
    ```

-   **`pd analysis retry`**: Retries failed or stale analyses.

    ```bash
    # Retry analyses that have been stuck for 1 hour
    pd analysis retry --timeout-hours 1
    ```

### `config` Group

Manage your application's environment settings.

-   **`pd config list`**: Lists all configuration key-value pairs.

    ```bash
    # List all configurations
    pd config list

    # Show secret values without masking
    pd config list --show-secrets
    ```

-   **`pd config get`**: Retrieves a specific configuration value.

    ```bash
    # Get the value of a specific key
    pd config get POSTGRES_USER
    ```

-   **`pd config set`**: Sets or unsets a configuration value.

    ```bash
    # Set a new value
    pd config set LOG_LEVEL "DEBUG"

    # Unset a value
    pd config set LOG_LEVEL --unset
    ```

### `db` Group

Handle database operations.

-   **`pd db migrate`**: Applies all pending database migrations.

    ```bash
    pd db migrate
    ```

-   **`pd db downgrade`**: Reverts the last database migration.

    ```bash
    pd db downgrade
    ```

-   **`pd db reset`**: **(Destructive)** Resets the database to its initial state.

    ```bash
    pd db reset
    ```

### `worker` Group

Control the background worker.

-   **`pd worker start`**: Starts the worker to listen for and process analysis tasks from the queue.

    ```bash
    # Start the worker
    pd worker start
    ```
