    Validates that the GCS cleanup fixture works with a real CLI command.

    This test works by:
    1.  Running the `analysis prepare` command to generate real artifacts in GCS
        under a unique, test-specific prefix.
    2.  Asserting that the artifacts were successfully created.
    3.  Relying on the `gcs_cleanup_manager` fixture's teardown process to
        automatically delete all the artifacts created during the test. The
        fixture itself handles the verification of the cleanup.

        db_session: The SQLAlchemy engine instance.
        e2e_pubsub: The Pub/Sub client and topic name.
